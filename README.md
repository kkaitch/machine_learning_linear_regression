## Project Goal
This project is to apply linear regression, gradient descent and regularization to tackle the California median house value.

## Introduction
This project has four parts:

* Part I: Getting Oriented
* Part II: Gradient Descent: Linear Regression
* Part III: Prediction
* Part IV: Regularization 

## Dataset
In this project, we will be using a version of the [California Housing Prices Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset) with additional information.
